This project was designed to transfer API Requests from a client to a Amazon Database in a multithreaded environment. The project used AWS services such as:

AWS SQL Server

Custom configured EC2 instances with Tomcat

Autoscaler

Load Balancer 

private network configuration

RabbitMQ EC2 instances 

Docker 

My Free account ran out of credits so my code will no longer work, but the code can be inspected for how an AWS configuration could look like with Java.
